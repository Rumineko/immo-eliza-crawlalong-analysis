## 📖 Description
The Second Part of our Project,

Features:

- Works off data collected from our first part of the project.
- Grabs the data and cleans empty values.
- Creates neat and interactive data to analyze Housing/Appartment statistics.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

- create a new virtual environment by executing this command in your terminal:
`python3 -m venv data_analysis_env`
- activate the environment by executing this command in your terminal:
`source data_analysis_env/bin/activate`
- install the required dependencies by executing this command in your terminal:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 👩‍💻 Usage
